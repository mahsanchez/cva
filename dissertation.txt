Monte Carlo Simulation (MC)

Financial problems are usually modelled using Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE). Most of the SDE
problems have a high dimensions integration problems and does not have a closed form solution. Hence, 
numerical methods in the area of stochastic simulations based on sampling methods 
basically simulate independent realizations of the stochastic phenomenon under consideration and then to compute an
estimate for the expectation of interest via an appropriate estimator obtained from independent samples.

In other words, one runs N independent computer experiments replicating the random variable Z, and then computes z from the sample. Use of random sampling or a method for computing a expectation is often called the Monte Carlo method. The estimator of z = E[Z] is an average of independent identical distributed copies of Z. Based on the Law of Large Numbers
for a given N < +oo the stocastic simulation converge to z = 1/n sum[Z] and for N large enough hold that 
En-1[Z] - En[Z] < epsilon. The epsilon value determine the converge criteria for the numerical methods and depends 
on the accuracy required in the specific problem context.

Key Issues arising in Monte Carlo Simulation
- Uniform/Gaussian Random generators
- Large floating point summation
- (Speeding up Convergence) using Variance Reduction
- Hardware Acceleration to improve Long execution time (due to large number of required sampling for convergence)

Expected Exposure

step 1 - HJM Model Calibration
step 2 - Evolve Risk Factor in the Future using MC Simulation
step 3 - Generate the Discount Factors and Forward Rates on each pricing point
step 4 - Perform IRS Mark to Market across pricing points
step 5 - Generate an Exposure Profile
step 6 - Run 2 through 6 N times ( N > 1000)
step 7 - Calculate the Expected Exposure profile averaging  N-Exposure Curves across all simulation points
step 8 - Run 2 through 6 N times ( N >> 1000 ) 
step 9 - Calculate the Expected Exposure profile averaging  N-Exposure Curves across all simulation points
step 10 - Perform a difference across simulation point for the EE calculated obtained in step 7 and step 9
step 11 - Each for each simulation point the difference is less than a threshold then stop simulation
step 12 - Repeat step 8 through 9 till the simulation converge
